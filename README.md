## Instructions for Use



1. **Setting Up the Environment:**

   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

   - Set the Flask app path: `$env:FLASK_APP="Backend.src"` (Windows) or `export FLASK_APP=Backend.src` (Linux/Mac).

   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.



2. **Running the Flask Application:**

   - Start the Flask server: `flask run`.

   - The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.



3. **Using Postman:**

   - Register an account: `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/register`

     ```json

     {

       "username": "Marko",

       "password": "555555"

     }

     ```

     - This request now returns the ID of the newly registered user.



   - Log in: `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`

     ```json

     {

       "username": "Marko",

       "password": "555555"

     }

     ```

     - This request returns an authorization token to use in subsequent requests. Add it in the Headers tab as `Bearer <token>`.



   - Add a transaction: `POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions`

     ```json

     {

       "user_id": "2",

       "cryptocurrency": "dogecoin",

       "amount": "1",

       "transaction_type": "buy"

     }

     ```

     - The `transaction_price` field has been removed as prices are now fetched in real time.



   - View transactions: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions`



   - View portfolio value: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/portfolio`

     - Returns the cryptocurrencies owned and the total value of the portfolio.



   - Advanced portfolio view: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/portfolio/advanced`

     - Expanded to include cryptocurrencies owned and the total value of the portfolio.



   - Delete a transaction: `DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/delete/<id>`



   - Delete all transactions: `DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/delete/all`



   - Update a transaction: `PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/update/<id>`

     ```json

     {

       "user_id": "2",

       "cryptocurrency": "bitcoin",

       "amount": "3",

       "transaction_type": "buy"

     }

     ```



   - View last transaction: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/session_data`

     ```json

     {

       "last_transaction": {

         "amount": 2,

         "cryptocurrency": "bitcoin",

         "transaction_type": "sell",

         "user_id": 4

       }

     }

     ```



   - View top 20 cryptocurrency prices: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/prices`



   - View price of a specified cryptocurrency: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/prices/<crypto>`

     - New route to get the price of a specific cryptocurrency.



   - View historical transaction data: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/history`

     ```json

     {

       "start_date": "2023-01-01",

       "end_date": "2023-12-31"

     }

     ```

     - New route to get historical transaction data. Filters by start and end dates and returns total value, total gain/loss, and cryptocurrency holdings.



   - **Filter Transactions:**

     - Example usages of the filter addon:

       - **View all transactions:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions`

       - **Filter by cryptocurrency:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions?cryptocurrency=bitcoin`

       - **Filter by transaction type:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions?transaction_type=buy`

       - **Filter by both criteria:** `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions?cryptocurrency=bitcoin&transaction_type=buy`



4. **Database Configuration:**

   - Configure PostgreSQL database in `config.py`:

     ```python

     SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name'

     ```

   - Initialize and upgrade the database:

     ```bash

     flask db init

     flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

     flask db upgrade
